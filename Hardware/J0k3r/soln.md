### Intended Solution
The given file is a `.logicdata` file, which is commonly used in Saleae Logic Software, a commonly used logic analyzer.
We can observe that there is data only in Channel 1.
There are different analyzers possible for the channel, so we can try the most common ones.
One of the most common protocol is UART/Serial comm. Hence using the `Async Serial` option helps out with that option, for the [baudrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud) since we have no clue we can go with `autobaudrate` option.  

On using the analyzer we are able to see the ASCII values decoded. Scrolling down to the list we can see the flag being printed character by character.

FLAG: inctf{b4tm4n_r!d3s_h!5_b4tM0bIl3_4_Lif3}
