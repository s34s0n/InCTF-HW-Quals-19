#### Solution
Images can be transmitted over amateur radio (ham-radio) using slow scan television (SSTV).
SSTV is a picture transmission method for transmitting and receiving static pictures via radio. Similar to a fax machine, or a 90s dial up modem, SSTV is an analogue audio signal that sounds like a high pitch racket of bleeps and screeches. It uses frequency modulation, where the frequency of a tone shifts up or down to designate pixel brightness and colour. A transmission consists of horizontal lines of pixels, scanned from left to right, encoded as audio. The audio is transmitted using radio and converted back into the picture at the other end using special software.
